## Feedback

This makes sense as an A&A project. Your README was clear and pretty thorough. 

When you ran this, did you remove the break in cell 3? If not, then you didn't really
do the thing you were saying you were going to do. (Which is part of the reason that output
says 5000 followers for each beer.) 

How did this expand to 5100 after you looked up the screen names? I'm
not sure `get_screen_names` is working properly. The input number of users
should be the same as the output. 

But, wow, the comparison document is thorough and must have been tedious to 
put together. Did you consider doing some kind of analysis across all of the 
followers at once and just talking about the things that made, say, Amstel followers
unique? Everyone seems to have "love" and "usa" among their most popular tokens, so it 
doesn't seem that informative. 

`This might just be the most boring beer on this list.`

Anyway, based on the issues in the pull, I was tempted to ask for a revision, but you 
suffered mightily for the analysis portion, so let's call this **complete**. You have
done some fun things, but it's buried across a lot of copy-and-paste code. If you ever
find yourself copying and pasting large chunks of code, you should go reread this
[wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
